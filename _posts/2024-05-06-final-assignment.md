# Final assignment for 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization
This assignment is made by students s204606, s194299 and s185382.  

## Introduction to the assignemnt (is this header necessary?)
As part of the Renewable Energy Directive in 2009, the European Union set a target that the pooled energy consumption in the EU should include 20% renewable energy by 2020. In 2018, this goal was revised to 32% by 2030, and again in 2023 to at least 42.5% at EU level by 2030. [1]
This continuous increase of the Renewable Energy directive indicates that the matter of global warming is more pressing than previously thought. This begs the question if the EU-targets have been effective in changing member countries’ energy production, and if the countries are in fact on track to reach the targets by 2030. This comparative analysis will therefore deep dive into the energy production of Denmark and Sweden, using the dataset ‘Global Electricity Production’ as the basis for analysis. This dataset includes daily data about energy production for 48 different countries, including the mode of production (solar, nuclear, wind etc), as well as imported and exported energy in GWh.  


## Intro Plot - Map of energy production over time 
To gain an initial insight into the production of energy worldwide, a map is constructed which shows the development in energy production from yearXX to yearXX. This visual tool helps in assessing the global trend towards greener energy sources.

%%%%Insert Map graph!! 

Comment on: renewabe energy production is very similar for Dk and Se, does not include nuclear power. 

## Plot 5 - different energy types % of production over time 
When looking into the different types of energy, Sweden and Denmark does display a significant difference. Sweden has a rather large production of nuclear power, which Denmark does not. Currently, nuclear power is not classified as a renewable energy source, but rather a 'low-carbon' energy source by the EU. This me
Comment on cultural differences, legislations etc.

## Plot 3 - Wind production over time (low in 2021) 
When is it important to have nuclear power? For example when the wind production is not very high - example in 2021. 

## Plot 2 - Trend lines 
Will we reach the EU target in 2050? 
Discussion - will need to think about
