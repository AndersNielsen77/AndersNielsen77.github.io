# Assignment 2 for 02806 Social Data Science and Visualization
This assignment is made by students s204606, s194299 and s185382. 

## Introduction to the assignment
This assignment compares the two police districts Tenderloin and Central, in north eastern San Fransisco, based on the dataset SF Crime Data. The districts are specifically compared for the crime category 'DRUG/NARCOTIC', where we visualize and study the difference between these two districts in regards to the crime category over time, for weekdays, and visualize where the crimes have happened in the districts. These specific districts are compared as there is a much higher drug and general crime activity in Tenderloin than in Central, despite Tenderloin being much smaller in size, and the districs bordering each other. According to Wikipedia, drug crimes in Tenderloin have escalated since 2007, and parking in both sides of streets in the district was banned in early 2014 in an attempt to curb some of the narcotics crimes.

From the bar chart it appears that crimes related to drugs and narcotics are noticeably higher in Tenderloin than in Central. There is a general declining trend, implying that some of the city's regulations and attempts to mitigate crime has worked, as the drug crimes in Tenderloin decrease after the parking law in 2014.
